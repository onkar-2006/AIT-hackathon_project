## Project Overview
This project focuses on **enemy detection** and **tracking** using **OpenCV** to ensure **real-time safety** for the Indian Army. The system uses video feeds (from surveillance cameras or drones) to detect enemy threats and track their movements. It provides **automated alerts** to military personnel to help in timely decision-making and responses.

## Technologies Used
- **OpenCV**: For image processing and computer vision tasks (detection and tracking).
- **Python**: The main programming language used to develop the system.
- **Twilio**: To send automated **SMS alerts** to designated personnel for real-time updates.
- **Deep Learning Models**: (Optional) For advanced object detection (e.g., YOLOv5 for detecting specific targets like vehicles, soldiers, etc.).
- **Surveillance Systems**: Integrated with live video feeds from cameras or drones.
